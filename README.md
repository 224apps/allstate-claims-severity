Because of new innovations in computing power, machine can predict certain output with models that can be trained using training data generated by users. There are three ways machine learning are used today: supervised, unsupervised and Reinforcement learning.In this paper, we will focus on supervised learning which is using the training data to get a hypothetical function. By minimizing the cost function we can accurately predict future results.
As a car owner, the last thing I want to have when involved in an accident is pushing paperwork with my insurer. Symmetrically, ​AllState,​ one of the biggest car insurers in the United State wants to predict the costs of an accident, hence the severity of claims.
